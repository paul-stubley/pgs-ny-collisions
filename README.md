# Context
This repo contains a python Flask app that is published to [Heroku](https://pgs-ny-collisions.herokuapp.com/)

# ToDo
- I'd like to load the page before running the python command, otherwise the page load is very slow.
- It would be good to get some input from the website to go back to the python backend at some point (e.g. suggested new hospital locations)
